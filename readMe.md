# Conway's Game of Life
The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, alive or dead. Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:

1.	Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.
2.	Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3.	Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
4.	Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

The game has for countrols
# start button
    This button start generation of cells from generation 0 to n
# stop button
    pauses generation of cells
# next button
    In case the game is paused this button can be used to generate the next generation of cells    
# clear button
    This resets the game to generation 0 of cells, which are all dead by default

Each cell is clickable, whenever a cell is clicked, its status change to alive or dead
